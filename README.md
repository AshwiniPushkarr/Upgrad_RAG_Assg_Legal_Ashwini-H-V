Upgrad Legal QnA System â€“ Project Summary (RAG & NLP)
This project involved building a Legal Question-Answering (QnA) system using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, integrating LangChain, OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3.5-turbo, and text-embedding-3-small, with vector databases like FAISS and Qdrant.

Legal documents were preprocessed, chunked, and embedded for semantic search. These embeddings were stored in vector databases to support similarity-based retrieval. A custom LangChain pipeline was developed to generate context-aware answers. The system was evaluated using benchmark answers within pandas DataFrames.

âœ… Key Highlights
The model produced relevant answers when appropriate source context was available.

Token limitations constrained input size, which impacted response accuracy.

FAISS and Qdrant showed comparable retrieval performance.

A custom LangChain RAG chain successfully supported contextual answering.

ðŸš€ Future Improvements
Scale the system to support larger datasets

Enhance evaluation methodology

Optimize the retrieval and chunking pipeline

This project showcases the complete pipeline for building a RAG-based QnA system tailored to legal document understanding and retrieval.
